        <h3>Data Engineer.</h3>
        <p>From cleaning the data to presenting it on dashboard with proper insights that can help businesses grow and analyse any change in pattern,
        I really like to play and present with data. At times it really gets tough working with data but that's the fun. Data has the real power so generating valuable
        insights and managing it makes me feel empowered. Currently I'm a Data Analyst at Innovaccer and everyday is a challenge which makes me learn. Hope to work in this domain
        with top data companies.

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>The craze of development started from a dilemma that whether I should choose Machine Learning or development as a career option. I found out that I wanted to
        make this cool apps and help contributing the society with my ideas. While I was learning Android from Udemy, I came across this cool course
        about web development. The challenges present in there made me more motivated to learn this stuff and widen my thinking. This has helped me a lot
        in having mental peace and to grow my career.</p>
