        <h3>Data Engineer.</h3>
        <p>From cleaning the data to presenting it on dashboard with proper insights that can help businesses grow and analyse any change in pattern,
        I really like to play and present data. At times it really gets tough working with huge amount of information but that's the fun. It has the real power so generating valuable
        insights and managing it makes me feel empowered. Currently I'm a Data Analyst at Innovaccer and everyday is a challenge which makes me learn. Hope to work in this domain
        with top data companies.

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>The first step of my career started with the interest of development. I was always curious about how mobile applications and these fast responsive websites were built.
        Gradually I started to see the result of the lines of code that I wrote. Developing has always been fun as the errors and results are clearly visible. I don't get to develop 
        that often but whenever I get the chance I grab it.</p>

        <h3>Competititve Programming.</h3>
        <p>I have always been competitive in nature and the best platform to compete with my DSA skills were competitive coding platforms. This grew as a habit and I started taking part 
          in coding competitions organised by Codechef, HackerEarth, Google Kickstart and on many more platforms. Later on these skills helped me landing my first career goal. I have been 
          benefited a lot by programming so I try to solve atleast 5 questions daily.</p>
